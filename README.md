# springrest
- First step towards learning the SPRING-BOOT framework. 
- This project is based on Youtube Video by `Durgesh` [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdDDuQuX2cg)
- In this application I have tried to implement application based on REST api based on `Course` entity.  
- APIs are provided for this app are 

|Method|API urls|Operation|
|------|--------|---------|
| GET  |/courses|Get all course|
| GET  |/courses/{courseId}|Get info regarding single Course|
| POST |/courses|Add new course|
| PUT  |/courses|Update the Course|
| DELETE|/courses/{courseId}|Delete the course Id|

- **Note**: These APIs are tested using POSTMAN, to return data in JSON format.
