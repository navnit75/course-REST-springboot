# Introduction
- Basic REST application, made with the help of `Springboot` and `Hibernate(JPA)` support. 
- This project is based on [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdDDuQuX2cg) by `Durgesh`.
- To simulate a object relationship behaviour , all operations are based on entity `Course`. 
- APIs extended are provided below and can be tested using `POSTMAN`.
