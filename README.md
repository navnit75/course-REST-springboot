# Introduction
- Basic REST application, made with the help of `Springboot` and `Hibernate(JPA)` support. 
- This project is based on [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdDDuQuX2cg) by `Durgesh`.
- To simulate a object relationship behaviour , all operations are based on entity `Course`. 
- APIs extended are provided below and can be tested using `POSTMAN`.

# APIs
|Method|API urls|Operation|
|------|--------|---------|
| GET  |/courses|Get all course|
| GET  |/courses/{courseId}|Get info regarding single Course|
| POST |/courses|Add new course|
| PUT  |/courses|Update the Course|
| DELETE|/courses/{courseId}|Delete the course Id|

# To Do 
- Add Front end to the project.
